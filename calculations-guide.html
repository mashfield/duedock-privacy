<h1>DueDock Calculations Guide</h1><p><em>Understanding how DueDock calculates your bills and coverage</em></p><p>---</p><h2>What Are Calculations in DueDock?</h2><p>DueDock automatically calculates several important things to help you manage your money. Think of it as your personal financial calculator that runs in the background. Here's what it figures out and how it works.</p><p>---</p><h2>Bill Calculations</h2><h3>Current Bill Amount</h3><br>Every bill has a <strong>current amount</strong> - the money you actually need to pay. DueDock calculates this based on:</p><p><strong>For regular bills:</strong><br>- Use the amount you entered when setting up the bill</p><p><strong>For variable bills:</strong><br>- Use the actual amount you enter (like your credit card statement balance)</p><h3>Remaining Amount</h3><br>The <strong>remaining amount</strong> is what you still owe after making payments:</p><pre><code>Remaining Amount = Current Amount - Amount Already Paid</code></pre><p><strong>Example:</strong><br>- Bill: $100<br>- Paid: $30<br>- Remaining: $70</p><h3>Payment Progress</h3><br>DueDock shows a progress bar for bills you've partially paid:</p><pre><code>Progress = (Amount Paid ÷ Total Amount) × 100%</code></pre><p>This helps you see how much of each bill you've paid off.</p><p>---</p><h2>Coverage Calculations</h2><h3>What is Coverage?</h3><br>Coverage tells you: <em>"Will my next paycheck cover all my bills before it arrives?"</em></p><p>DueDock looks at:<br>1. <strong>How much money you have coming in</strong> (your next income)<br>2. <strong>How much you need to pay</strong> (all bills due before that income arrives)</p><h3>The Coverage Check Formula</h3><br>DueDock adds up all bills due in your coverage period and compares to your income:</p><p><strong>Coverage Check = Sum of all bills due before next income</strong></p><p><strong>🚨 CRITICAL: How DueDock Calculates Bill Amounts for Coverage</strong></p><p>For <strong>regular bills</strong> (not installment):<br>- Uses <strong>remaining amount</strong> = Total amount - Amount already paid<br>- Example: $1000 bill with $300 paid = $700 in coverage calculation</p><p>For <strong>installment bills</strong>:<br>- Uses remaining installment = Partial payment amount - Amount paid toward installment<br>- Example: $200 installment with $50 paid = $150 in coverage calculation</p><p>The Coverage Check displays:<br>- Total amount of bills: $X (using remaining amounts, not full totals)<br>- Next income amount: $Y on [date]</p><p>You decide if $Y covers $X.</p><h3>Coverage Period</h3><br>You can adjust the <strong>coverage period</strong> using plus/minus buttons:<br>- <strong>0</strong> = Look at bills due before next income<br>- <strong>1</strong> = Look at bills due before income after next<br>- <strong>2</strong> = Look at bills due before income two periods away</p><p>This helps you plan ahead for multiple pay periods.</p><h3>Same-Day Conflicts</h3><br>Sometimes bills are due <strong>the same day</strong> as your income. DueDock shows these as conflicts because sometimes pre-authorized payments require funds to be in your account <strong>the day before</strong> the payment is actually withdrawn.</p><p>This creates uncertainty: if you pay a bill on the same day you receive income, the payment might not clear in time for the withdrawal.</p><p>DueDock shows these as conflicts and lets you:<br>- Choose to include them in coverage totals<br>- Decide which to pay first</p><p>---</p><h2>Installment Calculations</h2><h3>What Are Installments?</h3><br>Installments let you break large bills into smaller monthly payments:</p><p>- <strong>Partial Payment Amount</strong>: How much you pay each time (like $200/month)<br>- <strong>Paid Toward Installment</strong>: How much you've paid so far ($400 total paid)</p><h3>Remaining Installment Amount</h3><br>DueDock calculates how much is left to pay on each installment:</p><pre><code>Remaining = Partial Payment Amount - Paid Toward Installment</code></pre><p><strong>Example:</strong><br>- Monthly payment: $200<br>- Paid so far: $50<br>- Still need to pay: $150</p><h3>Installment Progress</h3><br>You can see progress bars showing how close you are to completing each installment:</p><pre><code>Installment Progress = (Paid ÷ Monthly Amount) × 100%</code></pre><p>---</p><h2>Income Calculations</h2><h3>Income in Period</h3><br>DueDock sums up all income you expect to receive in a period:</p><pre><code>Total Income = Sum of all incomes in the selected period</code></pre><h3>Income Date Boundaries</h3><br>DueDock uses <strong>start and end dates</strong> to figure out which incomes belong in each period:<br>- Start: Usually today<br>- End: Based on your coverage period setting</p><p>---</p><h2>Savings Goal Calculations</h2><h3>Goal Progress</h3><br>DueDock shows how close you are to reaching savings goals:</p><pre><code>Progress = (Amount Contributed ÷ Target Amount) × 100%</code></pre><h3>Remaining Amount Needed</h3><br><pre><code>Remaining = Target Amount - Amount Contributed</code></pre><p><strong>Example:</strong><br>- Goal: $1,000<br>- Saved: $300<br>- Still need: $700</p><p>---</p><h2>Section Totals</h2><h3>Account Totals</h3><br>DueDock adds up all bills for each account:</p><pre><code>Account Total = Sum of all bills for that account</code></pre><p>This helps you see spending by bank account or credit card.</p><h3>Period Totals</h3><br>DueDock calculates totals for different time periods:<br>- This week's bills<br>- This month's bills<br>- Bills in your coverage period</p><p>---</p><h2>When Calculations Update</h2><p>DueDock recalculates automatically when you:</p><p>- <strong>Add or edit a bill</strong><br>- <strong>Make a payment</strong><br>- <strong>Change income dates</strong><br>- <strong>Update variable bill amounts</strong><br>- <strong>Adjust coverage period</strong></p><p>---</p><h2>Edge Cases Handled</h2><h3>Zero Income</h3><br>If you have no income set up, DueDock focuses on bill management only.</p><h3>Overdue Bills</h3><br>Overdue bills are highlighted in red but still included in all calculations.</p><h3>Negative Amounts</h3><br>DueDock prevents negative amounts from displaying (shows $0 minimum).</p><h3>Same-Day Payments</h3><br>Bills due on income day can be included or excluded from coverage.</p><p>---</p><h2>Important Notes</h2><h3>Date Consistency</h3><br>All calculations use <strong>start of day</strong> for dates to avoid time-of-day confusion.</p><h3>Currency Handling</h3><br>All amounts use <strong>Double precision</strong> for accurate calculations.</p><h3>Variable Bills</h3><br>When you enter actual amounts, DueDock immediately updates all calculations.</p><h3>Override Flags</h3><br>You can force same-day bills into coverage calculations when needed.</p><p>---</p><h2>Quick Reference</h2><p><strong>Bill Calculations:</strong><br>- Current amount: Use actual amount for variable bills<br>- Remaining: Total minus paid<br>- Progress: Paid ÷ Total × 100%</p><p><strong>Coverage Check:</strong><br>- Total bills due before next income<br>- Compare to income amount<br>- Adjust period with plus/minus buttons</p><p><strong>Installments:</strong><br>- Remaining = Monthly amount - Paid so far<br>- Progress bars show completion</p><p><strong>Savings Goals:</strong><br>- Progress = Saved ÷ Target × 100%<br>- Remaining = Target - Saved</p><p>---</p><p><em>This guide explains DueDock's calculations in plain language.
