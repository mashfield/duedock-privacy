Setup (One Time)</h3><br>Add your information:<br>- Your income sources and pay dates<br>- All your regular bills with amounts and due dates<br>- Your bank accounts/credit cards</p><h3>2.

DueDock shows these as conflicts because sometimes pre-authorized payments require funds to be in your account <strong>the day before</strong> the payment is actually withdrawn.</p><p>This creates uncertainty: if you pay a bill on the same day you receive income, the payment might not clear in time for the withdrawal.</p><p>DueDock shows these as conflicts and lets you decide which to include in totals. Use a toggle to include pre-authorized payments when you're confident the timing will work.</p><h3>🔄 Variable Bills</h3><br>Some bills change each month (like credit cards):<br>- Mark bills as "variable"<br>- Enter actual amount when you get the bill<br>- DueDock uses the real amount for calculations</p><h3>💰 Payment History</h3><br>Track all your payments:<br>- Records when you paid each bill<br>- Shows payment progress<br>- Stores proof of payment if needed</p><p>---</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><h3>Week 1: Setup</h3><br>1.
